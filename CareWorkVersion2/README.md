About · 華笙 / Night Matters

“Night Matters / 華笙” is an experimental web archive that traces the memories, spaces, and sounds of club culture in China. This project is important to me because nightlife is often dismissed as “just partying,” yet for many queer, marginalized, and creative communities, night spaces are where care, kinship, and self-definition quietly happen. 

I am creating this website for people who feel connected to underground clubs, drag shows, and dance floors, but don’t always see their stories preserved in official histories. “Night Matters” wants to tell the story that nightlife is not a distraction from real life, but a site where resistance, softness, and survival co-exist.

This project for me is an interactive memorial to the underground clubs that shaped my relationship with rave culture. With the one I loved most shutting down recently due to economic pressure, its closure made me realize how fragile these cultural spaces are. They hold entire eras of sound, sweat, friendships, and identity, yet they can disappear quietly, leaving almost no trace. And that's why I want to have such a place, a quite corner, where those story, those clubs are remembered.
